    In Trace, the very import difference is that we take NOT mesh-grid inputs
    to evaluate the mapping and so on. This is because we have different faces
    (3D) or edges (2D) for the trace mapping. If we use the mesh-grid points
    as we did in CoordinateTransformation, then, for example, in 3D case, we 
    needs 6 inputs of shape = (2,), at least, which is not a smart way.

        When even we try to compute the trace mapping or trace Jacobian_matrix,
        we run this method before hands to generate proper points (in reference
        coordinates) for 4 edges(2D) or 6 sides(3D).
        
        This looks very bad, since if we have done trace mapping, when we 
        further compute trace Jacobian, we will repeat it again, why not just 
        store it? No, we do not do this, because we always search 
        evaluation_points_gird from `self._ct_`, and when we reset 
        evaluation_points_gird, we will have to reset the stored value as well.
        Of course, this is doable, but I think it makes the code a little bit
        more un-readable. And what is more, this process is very fast, so, who
        cares if we run it one more time?
