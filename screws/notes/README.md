We store some notes here. 

These notes are mainly for testing purpose. For example, when we want to apply some
new functions to the mifem library, we test them here. Or also, when we find something new 
which may be useful for the mifem library in the future, we first put them here in case we 
forget how to use them.


IMPORTANT: in this folder, we DO NOT use the structure of naming files and folders of the mifem library.
